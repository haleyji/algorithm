        Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

        This problem was asked by Google.

        The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

        For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.
    </p>
</div>
<script>
    function getPowerSet(list) {
        //a,b
        const result = [];
        let idx = 0;
        while(idx<list.length){


        }


        return result;
    }

</script>
